# Cocke Kasami Younger Algorithm #

This is an application of the CKY algorithm to find out if a grammar is capable of producing a determined word.

This program was developed during an automata course as a course project.

The program uses a class called producction, which specifies a grammars production stated in Chomsky normal form. The programs main file is a console application that uses lists and matrixes to apply this algorithm and finally prints either True or False if the introduced word is produced or not by the grammar.

The developers are:

- Max Rasguido
- Oscar Sanjinez
- Min Bo Zhong
